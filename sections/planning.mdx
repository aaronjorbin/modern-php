# Backup Your Site

<Notes>Creating a backup will ensure you can revert your site to its previous state if anything goes wrong during the update.</Notes>

# Update All The Things

* WordPress
* Themes
* Plugins

<Notes>Before updating PHP versions, update WordPress, all themes, and all plugins to their latest versions. Make sure your site is working as expected afterwards! By updating these, you'll ensure everything should hopefully be up-to-date for modern PHP.</Notes>

# Check PHP Compatibility

<Notes>You can install a PHP Compatibility Checker plugin to ensure your site is up-to-date and ready for the update. If something isn't compatible, the plugin will notify you. This isn't a perfect solution as it's simply automated scanning, but plugins like these do a very good job at catching the majority of potential issues.</Notes>

# Resolve Compatibility Issues

<Notes>If there are issues flagged in a plugin or theme, contact the plugin or theme developer and let them know -- there may already be an open ticket for the issue! Subscribe for updates if a fix is in-progress, or, if possible, find a similiar plugin or theme that's kept up-to-date with modern PHP.</Notes>

# Ship It

<Notes>This depends on your hosting company. Some companies allow you to update the PHP version in your site's account settings, while others require you to contact them for updates. The shortlink here will take you to a repository that contains instructions to update at many different hosting companies.</Notes>
