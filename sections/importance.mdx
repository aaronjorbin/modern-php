# Better Performance

<Notes>
    Updating to the latest supported version (currently 7.3) can deliver a huge performance increase.
    Up to 3 or 4x faster for older versions.
    Modern PHP is more efficient.
    Speed tests using WP 5.0 and PHP7.3 execute 3X requests / second vs WP 5.0 and PHP5.6, 9% faster than PHP 7.2 on average (per Kinsta speed testing).

# More Secure

<Notes>
    Keeping up-to-date is essential to keeping your site secure.
    The latest version will have the latest security features.
    PHP core team doesn't support versions long-term.
    Active support lasts for 2 years, security support ends 1 year after that.
    7.0 security support ended in Jan, 7.1 will end in Dec -- then these will be exposed to unpatched security vulnerabilities.

# Overall Compatibility

<Notes>
    Plugin and theme developers only extend support for older versions so far.
    Things will eventually break if you run on old versions.
